# Herald OS Linux

Herald OS as a whole operating system: a Fedora base, greetd signing you in, niri arranging the
windows, the Herald shell drawing the menu bar, dock and system menus, and Hermes Agent underneath.
Today it runs in a virtual machine on your Mac; nothing on the Mac changes.

```
kernel + systemd  ->  greetd (autologin: hermes)  ->  niri  ->  Herald OS shell  ->  hermes serve
                                                                      |                    |
                                                          HostPlatform (linux.ts)   herald-os-bridge (LinuxHost)
                                                                      \__________  ps ss nmcli wpctl gio journalctl plocate
```

## Quick start (QEMU, all from the terminal)

```bash
brew install qemu                       # once
bash linux/vm/download-image.sh         # Fedora Cloud Base aarch64 qcow2 (~500 MB)
bash linux/vm/make-seed.sh              # cloud-init seed + SSH key (linux/vm/build/)
bash linux/vm/run-qemu.sh               # boots; first boot provisions (30-45 min, mostly downloads)
bash linux/vm/run-qemu.sh console       # watch it; wait for "==> Provisioning complete"
bash linux/dev/push.sh                  # push the repo, build the shell, start Herald OS
```

A QEMU window appears on the Mac. After provisioning and the first push, the VM starts Herald OS
with no login prompt, and every later boot goes straight to it. `bash linux/vm/run-qemu.sh
stop|status|reset` manage it.

Window size: QEMU shows guest pixels 1:1 with the Mac's device pixels. The framebuffer defaults to
the main display's width and its height minus the menu and title bars (3024x1820 on a 14-inch
MacBook Pro), so the window fills the screen; override with `GUEST_W`/`GUEST_H`. On Retina, set
`HERALD_OS_SCALE=2` in `session.env` and `scale 2` in `~/.config/niri/local.kdl` so the desktop
matches Mac apps in size. View -> Zoom To Fit in QEMU's menu still works (toggle it after boot;
enabling it at launch makes the guest adopt the initial window size).

### Signing Hermes in

Hermes in the VM starts signed out. Sign it in from the card Herald OS shows (a short code you
confirm on any device), or from a shell in the VM:

```bash
bash linux/dev/push.sh ssh
hermes setup          # any provider, including API keys; `hermes portal` for Nous Portal only
```

`--with-hermes-config` copies `~/.hermes/{config.yaml,.env}` (model choice and any API keys) into
the VM. It deliberately does not copy `auth.json`: OAuth providers (Nous Portal, Codex, Copilot)
use rotating refresh tokens, so a copied login works only until the next refresh and whichever
machine refreshes second is logged out. (`--with-hermes-auth` copies it anyway, for short
experiments where that trade-off is fine.)

To use the Mac's Nous Portal sign-in without copying it, run Hermes's subscription proxy on the Mac
and point the VM at it. The credentials stay on the Mac, which is the only machine that refreshes
them:

```bash
hermes proxy start                       # on the Mac; serves http://127.0.0.1:8645/v1
bash linux/dev/push.sh ssh               # then, in the VM:
hermes config set model.provider custom
hermes config set model.base_url http://10.0.2.2:8645/v1   # QEMU's address for the Mac
hermes config set model.api_key proxy    # any value; the proxy attaches the real token
hermes config set model.default <model>  # a Portal model id, as in the Mac's config.yaml
```

## Quick start (UTM, a nicer window)

1. `brew install --cask utm`. Run `download-image.sh` and `make-seed.sh` as above.
2. UTM: Create a New Virtual Machine, Virtualize, Linux. Tick "Use Apple Virtualization".
   Boot from `linux/vm/build/fedora-cloud-44-aarch64.qcow2` (import the disk; UTM converts it).
   4 cores, 8 GB, "Enable hardware OpenGL acceleration".
3. Add a second drive from `linux/vm/build/cidata.iso` (read-only, removable).
4. Sharing: add a VirtioFS shared directory pointing at this repo, tag `herald-os`.
5. Network: emulated VLAN with a port forward, guest 22 -> host 2222 (or use Bridged and set
   `HERALD_VM_HOST=<vm-ip>` for the scripts).
6. Boot. cloud-init mounts the share at `/mnt/herald-os`, provisions, builds the shell from the
   share, and greetd starts the desktop. Later, inside the VM, `herald-os-sync` re-syncs and
   rebuilds from the share; from the Mac `bash linux/dev/push.sh` works too.

## What provisioning does (`linux/provision.sh`)

- SELinux permissive (greetd and the compositors have no tailored policy yet; Stage 2 writes one).
- `dnf install`: niri, cage, greetd, seatd, PipeWire, NetworkManager, BlueZ, UPower, portals,
  Electron runtime libraries, fonts, Node.js + toolchain, and the CLI tools the Linux adapters use
  (`xdg-utils`, `gio`, `plocate`, `fd`, `rsvg-convert`, `notify-send`, `grim`), plus Firefox,
  Nautilus, Text Editor and `foot` as a rescue terminal.
- Hermes Agent cloned to `~/.hermes/hermes-agent` at the revision in `upstream/UPSTREAM.lock`,
  installed with upstream's `setup-hermes.sh` (prompts answered "no").
- Session files installed (below); `greetd` enabled; default target `graphical`.
- Dev helpers on the `hermes` user's PATH: `herald-os-build`, `herald-os-sync`,
  `herald-os-restart-shell`, `herald-os-shot`.

## Session model (`linux/session/`)

| Piece | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `/etc/greetd/config.toml` | Logs `hermes` in on VT1 and runs `herald-os-compositor`. Respawns when it exits. |
| `herald-os-compositor` | Sets `XDG_*`, picks `WLR_RENDERER=pixman` when there is no GPU render node, sources `~/.config/herald-os/session.env`, then starts niri with the managed config. Without hardware GL (QEMU and Apple Virtualization without virgl) niri runs windowed inside `cage` (`herald-os-niri-nested`). `HERALD_OS_COMPOSITOR=cage` runs the Stage 1 kiosk instead. |
| `herald-os-session` | Publishes `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` to systemd/D-Bus, starts PipeWire + portals and the session services below, runs Electron on Wayland (Ozone) as panels: the menu bar, dock and Hermes window are separate windows niri places. Restarts the shell on a crash (5 per minute), exits on a clean quit. |
| `herald-os.desktop` | `wayland-sessions` entry so a normal greeter can also start Herald OS. |

The Hermes backend is still spawned by the shell (`electron/backend/manager.ts`), the same as on
macOS. A systemd unit comes with the Stage 2 broker.

`~/.config/herald-os/session.env` overrides (all optional; changes to this file or to the session
scripts need `sudo systemctl restart greetd`, because the running session loop keeps its old copy):

```
HERALD_OS_SCALE=1.5                          # page zoom for HiDPI framebuffers (1.5 for 2048x1280, 2 for 2880x1800)
HERALD_OS_DEV_SERVER=http://127.0.0.1:5180   # load the Vite dev server instead of dist/
HERALD_OS_REMOTE_DEBUG_PORT=9333             # Chrome DevTools protocol for scripted checks
HERALD_OS_NO_SANDBOX=1                       # if user namespaces are disabled
HERALD_OS_APP=/path/to/apps/desktop          # alternate build location
```

## Dev loop

- **From the Mac**: `bash linux/dev/push.sh` (rsync over SSH, build, restart shell,
  ~30 s). `bash linux/dev/push.sh ssh` opens a shell. `bash linux/dev/shot.sh` grabs a screenshot
  via `grim` into `linux/vm/build/shots/`.
- **Inside the VM** (UTM share): `herald-os-sync`. Logs: `~/.local/state/herald-os/shell.log`,
  `journalctl -u greetd`, `journalctl --user -b`.
- HMR: run `npm run dev:renderer` in an SSH session and set `HERALD_OS_DEV_SERVER` in
  `session.env`, then `herald-os-restart-shell`.

Native modules must be installed on Linux, so the repo is copied (rsync) rather than used in place
from the share; `node_modules`, `dist`, `.git` and the upstream snapshot are excluded and fetched
inside the VM by `scripts/bootstrap.sh`.

## Services (niri session)

`herald-os-session` starts, as transient user units: `wl-paste --watch cliphist store` (text and
images; `Mod+Ctrl+V` opens the picker), and `herald-os-idle`, which runs `swayidle` with the timings
from Settings > General (`~/.config/herald-os/idle.conf`: screensaver, lock after 10 min only when
the account has a password, screens off after 15, no sleep by default; "stay awake" stops the
unit). Night light is `wlsunset` as the `herald-os-nightlight` unit. Notifications from other apps
arrive through the shell's own `org.freedesktop.Notifications` daemon. The `hermes` VM user has no password by default, so
`herald-os lock` refuses until you run `herald-os password` in a terminal; a lock nobody can undo
would leave the compositor's session lock engaged.

`Mod+M` or `Mod+Alt+Space` opens the control menu (Install / Remove / Update / Style / Trigger /
System / Hermes); every item is a `herald-os` command, so the agent (`system_os` tool) and scripts
can do the same. `Mod` is `Super` on real hardware and `Alt` when niri runs nested (the QEMU VM),
where `Mod+Alt+Space` is only `Alt+Space` and `Mod+M` is the way in. `Mod+K` lists every hotkey.
Web apps (`herald-os install webapp <name> <url>`) open as their own frameless windows.

The menu bar's status items open quick panels (`herald-os panel wifi|bluetooth|audio|display|power|clock`,
backed by `nmcli`, `bluetoothctl`, `pactl`, `niri msg output`, `powerprofilesctl` and `upower`).
Dictation (`Mod+Ctrl+X`, `herald-os dictate`) records until a pause, transcribes through Hermes's
speech-to-text and types the words into the focused app with `wtype`; the emoji picker
(`Mod+Ctrl+E`) types its pick the same way. `herald-os keymap omarchy` renders
`~/.config/niri/config.kdl` from the template in `/usr/local/share/herald-os-linux/niri/` with
Omarchy's `Super+C/X/V` copy, cut and paste; `herald-os keymap herald` restores Herald's keys.

## Themes, omakase, updates

- **Themes** live in `linux/themes/<name>/theme.json` (ocean, ice, violet, graphite). `herald-os
  theme set <name>` (or Style → Theme in the control menu, or the agent's `system_os theme_set`)
  recolours the shell, niri borders/backdrop (`~/.config/niri/theme.kdl`), swaylock, GTK 3/4
  (`gtk.css` + `gsettings`), and the `foot` rescue terminal in one step; a theme may also ship a
  wallpaper. Add a theme by dropping a folder into `~/.config/herald-os/themes/`.
- **Widgets** (ADR-019) live in `~/.config/herald-os/plugins/<id>/`: a `manifest.json` and web
  files, shown in the menu bar, on the Overview or in their own window. `herald-os plugin add
  <git-url>` clones one turned off; `herald-os plugin list | enable | disable | update | remove`
  manage them, and `enable` prints what the widget may do and asks at the terminal. Settings >
  Plugins does the same, and Hermes's `system_os plugin_*` actions can do everything except turn
  one on. Each runs in a sandboxed frame served from `herald-plugin://<id>/`, under a Content
  Security Policy that allows only its own files and the hosts it was granted. The manual's
  [Make it yours](manual/make-it-yours.md#widgets) explains how to write one.
- **The menu bar, the menu and branding.** `herald-os bar` shows, hides and moves menu-bar items
  and sets the clock (the `bar.*` commands behind Settings > Appearance > Menu bar).
  `~/.config/herald-os/menu.json` adds entries to the control menu, read each time it opens;
  `herald-os menu check` reports what it understood. `herald-os branding set --logo <image>
  --lock <image> --name <text>` copies the images into `~/.config/herald-os/branding/`; About
  shows the logo and name, and `herald-os lock` passes the picture to swaylock (`--image`,
  `--scaling fill`). Your own keys go in `~/.config/niri/local.kdl`, included last, where a bind
  replaces Herald's bind for the same key.
- **The install catalog** (`linux/catalog/*.json`, run by `herald-os-catalog`) is everything else
  worth one click: coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Copilot CLI through npm
  in `~/.local`), Ollama and LM Studio with "Use with Hermes", languages through mise, editors,
  terminals, games, a Windows 11 VM (`herald-os install windows`, dockur/windows under Podman), media
  apps, services and web apps. Each entry lists install methods in order (Flatpak, dnf, pacman, AUR,
  npm, mise, a recipe, a web app, a download page); the first one the machine can use wins, so the
  same catalog serves Fedora, Arch and Omarchy, and the image (Flatpak and `~/.local` only). It
  backs Settings > Software, Install and Remove in the control menu, `herald-os install <id>`, and
  Hermes's `system_os catalog_*` actions. On macOS the shell installs the entries that have a Mac
  method (npm, Homebrew, a download page).
- **Omakase** (`linux/omakase/{packages,flatpaks,webapps}.txt`) is the curated software set every
  install gets: Firefox, Nautilus, Text Editor, LibreOffice, Loupe, Papers, Calculator, Calendar,
  VLC, developer tools, fonts; Obsidian, Spotify, LocalSend, VS Code, Signal from Flathub; and web
  apps (HEY, Google Calendar/Messages, WhatsApp, X, YouTube, ChatGPT, GitHub) as their own windows.
  Provisioning installs it (`HERALD_OS_OMAKASE=0` to skip); `herald-os omakase install` re-syncs.
- **Updates**: `herald-os update` pulls the repo on the chosen channel (`herald-os channel
  stable|edge`; both track `main` until releases exist), runs one-shot `linux/migrations/*.sh`
  (tracked in `/var/lib/herald-os/migrations`), upgrades the system (dnf on Fedora, pacman and the
  AUR helper on Arch; on Omarchy it leaves the system to `omarchy-update`, which Omarchy requires;
  the Herald OS image updates as a whole with `bootc upgrade`) and Flatpaks, updates Hermes Agent,
  rebuilds the shell and restarts it. A daily user timer runs `herald-os update
  --check`, which lights the menu-bar indicator when anything is pending. A repo pushed from a Mac
  (no `.git`) skips the shell step; use `linux/dev/push.sh` there.

## The Herald OS image (Fedora bootc)

Herald OS ships as a bootable container image (ADR-018), built in two halves that the development
VM's provisioner also runs, so the VM and the image cannot drift apart:

- **`linux/image/packages.sh`, at image build:** the packages in `linux/image/packages.txt` (and the
  omakase set), the session and CLIs under `/usr`, the prebuilt shell in `/usr/share/herald-os/app`,
  the boot splash and its initramfs, Flathub, the services. `--dev` does the same for the VM under
  `/usr/local`, with the build tools from `packages-dev.txt`.
- **`linux/image/firstboot.sh`, on the first boot:** the session user, its niri config, theme and
  update timer, and Hermes Agent (`herald-os-firstboot.service`, before the login screen), then the
  omakase Flatpaks (`herald-os-firstboot-apps.service`, while the session is up).

`linux/image/Containerfile` starts from `quay.io/fedora/fedora-bootc:44`; `.github/workflows/image.yml`
builds it for x86_64 and aarch64 on matching runners, pushes it to the repository's GHCR package
(`ghcr.io/iamlukethedev/herald-os`, private like the repository) and, for a release, turns it into:

- **an x86_64 installer ISO** (bootc-image-builder `anaconda-iso`, `linux/image/iso.toml`): the
  storage screen stays interactive, so it installs next to another system and encrypts the disk
  (btrfs). Boot it with `inst.ks=<url>` and a kickstart like `linux/image/unattended.ks` for an
  unattended install.
- **an aarch64 VM disk** (`qcow2`, `linux/image/disk.toml`): `bash linux/vm/run-qemu.sh --image <disk>`
  or `bash linux/vm/run-vf.sh --image <disk>` boot it, and `bash linux/vm/try.sh` fetches the latest
  release's disk and boots it in one command.

On the image, apps install through Flatpak or into `~/.local` (the catalog picks those methods
there); the system itself changes only by a whole new image.

**Updates you can undo.** `herald-os update` runs `bootc upgrade` (the image tag of the channel:
`stable` for releases, `edge` for main; `herald-os channel edge` switches with `bootc switch`), then
Flatpaks and `hermes update`. The new image starts on the next restart and the previous one stays in
the boot menu; `herald-os rollback` (or Update > Go back to the previous version) makes it the
default again.

**Setup and reset.** The first boot makes the account and installs Hermes; then the shell's setup
asks who the computer is for. For yourself: a name, a password (set with `passwd` as you, so the
setup never needs root), Wi-Fi and Hermes's sign-in. For someone else: just Wi-Fi, and setup waits
for them at the next start. `herald-os reset` (type ERASE, then your password) erases the account,
its apps and saved networks on the next restart and runs setup again; the system stays.

**Security.**

- **Firewall:** firewalld with a `herald-os` zone that refuses incoming connections except LocalSend
  (port 53317) and mDNS. SSH is off in release images; the development VM's zone allows it.
- **Secure Boot:** works through Fedora's signed shim.
- **Sign-in:** `herald-os setup fingerprint` (fprintd) and `herald-os setup fido2` (a security key,
  pam-u2f) add them to the lock screen and sudo through authselect.
- **Firmware:** `herald-os firmware check|update` (fwupd), also in the menu under Update.
- **Image signatures:** the image workflow signs each image with the project's cosign key, never
  keyless (which would publish to a transparency log) and without a log upload. Once
  `linux/image/cosign.pub` is in the repository, the image only accepts signed updates of itself
  (a `sigstoreSigned` policy for `ghcr.io/iamlukethedev/herald-os`).
- **SELinux** stays permissive for now (ADR-012).

## Arch Linux (and Omarchy)

Fedora stays the base Herald OS builds and tests on (ADR-017); Arch gets a package.
`packaging/arch/herald-os-bin` packages the release tarball and `packaging/arch/herald-os-git` builds
from source; both lay out the same files: the app in `/opt/herald-os`, the CLIs and session scripts
in `/usr/bin`, shared data in `/usr/share/herald-os`, the session for the login screen in
`/usr/share/wayland-sessions/herald-os.desktop`, and Herald OS as an app in the application menu.
Neither is on the AUR yet; they are published once the project is public. Until then:

```bash
cd packaging/arch/herald-os-bin
HERALD_OS_TARBALL_URL=file:///path/to/herald-os-0.1.0-alpha.1-linux-x64.tar.gz makepkg -si
herald-os setup        # once per user: Hermes Agent and the bridge plugin
```

The session needs niri (and a login screen such as greetd); the optional dependencies list what
each panel and feature uses. `.github/workflows/arch.yml` builds the package from a fresh tarball in
an Arch container, lints it with namcap, installs it and runs the CLIs.

## Inside Hyprland and Omarchy (app mode)

Herald OS also runs as an app inside another compositor: `herald-os-app` starts the single-window
shell (fullscreen, as on macOS) and leaves the compositor's bar, keys and window rules alone. The
shell finds the compositor from `NIRI_SOCKET` or `HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE`; on Hyprland it mirrors
windows through `hyprctl -j` and the event socket, so "ask about this window" works, and `herald-os
wm` maps niri's action names to Hyprland dispatchers. The `herald-os` CLI reaches the one window
through the same control socket the niri session uses, so every `herald-os` command works as a key.

On Omarchy, `herald-os omarchy install` sets the rest up, and `herald-os omarchy remove` takes it out:

- **Theme:** a hook in `~/.config/omarchy/hooks/theme-set.d/` runs `herald-os theme omarchy` when the
  Omarchy theme changes, and Herald reads that theme's `colors.toml` (or `alacritty.toml`) and its
  background. Herald's `theme list`, `set` and `current` hand off to Omarchy's commands there.
- **Menu:** an entry in `~/.config/omarchy/extensions/omarchy-menu.jsonc`.
- **Keys:** one chord, `Super+Alt+H`, then Return (open Herald OS), A (ask), C (command bar),
  V (voice), X (dictate), E (emoji) or M (Missions), from `~/.config/hypr/herald-os.conf`.
- **Updates and installs:** `herald-os update` leaves the system to `omarchy-update` and catalog
  installs go through `omarchy-pkg-add` and the AUR helper Omarchy ships.

Files that already exist (a `theme-set` hook, a menu file) are never overwritten; the command prints
the line to add instead.

**Sharing a Hermes home.** Omarchy's Hermes Desktop owns `~/.hermes` and runs its own backend and
messaging gateway. A second backend from Herald is safe (Hermes takes a lock for every cron tick and
keeps one gateway per home), and Settings > Network says when another app's gateway is running. To
not run a second backend at all, start Herald with `HERALD_OS_BACKEND_URL=http://127.0.0.1:<port>`
and the backend's token in `HERALD_OS_BACKEND_TOKEN` (or `~/.config/herald-os/backend-token`); Herald
then attaches to it and writes `~/.hermes/herald-os/control.json` (mode 0600) so the bridge plugin
can still drive Herald's UI.

## Known limits

- No calendar (`calendar.today` reports `unavailable`); Evolution Data Server integration is later.
- QEMU has no GPU acceleration on macOS: niri runs nested inside cage, which renders with pixman,
  and Electron runs with `--disable-gpu`. UTM's Apple Virtualization backend gives virtio-gpu-gl.
- Under the `HERALD_OS_COMPOSITOR=cage` kiosk, a launched app (Firefox, Nautilus) covers the shell
  fullscreen and returns to it when closed; there is no switching between other apps' windows.
- SELinux is permissive on the VM.
- Apple Silicon Macs cannot boot this natively (no Asahi support for M4/M5); the VM is the target.
  x86 hardware comes with the ISO work in the roadmap.
