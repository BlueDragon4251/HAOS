# System Bridge

The system bridge is how Hermes acts on the computer. It is a Hermes plugin
(`plugins/herald-os-bridge`) that registers a small toolset named `herald_os`. Every capability is
an explicit tool with a typed schema, a permission tier, and an audit record. The model never gets
unrestricted machine access.

## Tools

| Tool | Tier | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `system_info` | read | OS version, hardware, uptime, CPU load, memory, disks, battery |
| `system_processes` | read | Top processes by CPU or memory, find by name, find by listening port |
| `system_disk_usage` | read | Largest entries under a directory (bounded depth and time) |
| `system_find_files` | read | File search (Spotlight on macOS, `plocate`/`fd` on Linux): name, kind, screenshots, date ranges, scope |
| `system_apps` | read | Installed applications and currently running applications |
| `system_network` | read | Connectivity (interfaces, gateway, DNS, Wi-Fi link) and Bluetooth devices |
| `system_logs` | read | Recent lines from the system log, filtered by level and process; recent crashes and one crash's facts (macOS crash reports, Linux core dumps) for the `diagnose-crash` skill |
| `system_control` | read / act / mutate | Volume, dark mode, notifications, System Settings panes, display sleep, screen lock; switching Wi-Fi asks first |
| `system_open` | act | Open an app, URL, file or folder; reveal in Finder; open a path in an editor |
| `system_kill_process` | destructive | Terminate a process by pid or by listening port |
| `system_files` | mutate / destructive | Create folders, move, rename, trash (never `rm`); `dry_run` plans |
| `os_ui` | per command | Operate the Herald OS interface: open pages and apps, add memories, run automations, start missions and Studio builds. Each command carries its own tier |
| `system_os` | act / mutate | Herald OS Linux only: install apps, reminders, themes, screenshots, lock, suspend, update |

"Start my development environment" is a skill: it composes `system_open` with Hermes's existing
`terminal` tool rather than adding another core-shaped tool.

## Permission tiers

| Tier | Behaviour | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `read` | Runs immediately, audited | info, processes, disk usage, search |
| `act` | Runs immediately, audited, surfaced as a notification | open Safari, open a repo in VS Code |
| `mutate` | Requires confirmation; `session` and `always` are honoured | mkdir, move, rename |
| `destructive` | Always requires confirmation; per-call rule key so `always` cannot persist | kill process, trash files |

Confirmation goes through upstream's `tools.approval.request_tool_approval`, which the shell
renders as its approval card. `approvals.mode: off` and yolo mode are honoured exactly as they are
for shell commands, because it is the same gate.

## Enabling

`scripts/bootstrap.sh` links the plugin into `$HERMES_HOME/plugins/herald-os-bridge`, then runs
`hermes plugins enable herald-os-bridge`, `hermes tools enable herald_os` (a saved platform toolset
list is authoritative upstream), and `hermes config set tools.tool_search.enabled off` so the tools
are directly callable rather than deferred behind Hermes's tool-search bridge (see
`DECISIONS.md`, ADR-010). Settings -> Privacy edits the policy file below and shows the audit log.

## Protected paths

Operations that would read or modify these locations are refused before any approval prompt:

- secrets: `~/.ssh`, `~/.gnupg`, `~/Library/Keychains`, `~/Library/Cookies`, `$HERMES_HOME/.env`,
  `$HERMES_HOME/auth.json`;
- system folders: `/System`, `/Library`, `/usr`, `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/etc`, `/private/etc`,
  `/var/db`, `/private/var/db`, and on Linux `/boot`, `/lib`, `/lib64`, `/var/lib`, `/proc`, `/sys`.

The list is extended (never shortened) in the policy file. The built-in list is
`BUILTIN_PROTECTED` in `bridge/permissions.py`.

## Policy file

`$HERMES_HOME/herald-os/permissions.yaml`

```yaml
version: 1
tiers:
  read: allow          # allow | confirm | deny
  act: allow
  mutate: confirm
  destructive: confirm # cannot be set to allow
protected_paths:
  - ~/Documents/Taxes
```

## Audit log

Every tool invocation appends one JSON line to `$HERMES_HOME/herald-os/audit.jsonl`:
`{ts, tool, tier, action, args, decision, ok, error}`. Arguments are truncated; no file contents are
logged.

## Platform abstraction

`bridge/host/base.py` defines `HostAdapter`. `darwin.py` implements it with `mdfind`, `open`,
`lsof`, `ps`, `osascript`, `system_profiler`, `vm_stat`; `linux.py` with `ps`, `ss`,
`plocate`/`fd`, `gio`, `xdg-open`, `nmcli`, `bluetoothctl`, `wpctl`, `gsettings` and `journalctl`
(shared POSIX parts live in `posix.py`). `windows.py` raises `HostNotSupported` with a clear
message. The adapters exist so the tool layer never branches on `sys.platform`.

## Tests

`npm run test:bridge` runs the plugin's pytest suite (`plugins/herald-os-bridge/tests`) with the
Hermes runtime's interpreter, or in a throwaway `uv` environment if that interpreter has no pytest.
